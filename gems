# EXTRA GEMS REQUIRED FOR TESTING
#
# Having a Gemfile in here as well as a Gemfile in Redmine's root seems to
# cause all kind of problems. As a workaround, gems are listed here. Append the
# contents of this file to #{Rails.root}/Gemfile.local if you want to run the
# tests.
#
# If you're not planning on running the tests, don't worry about this file.
